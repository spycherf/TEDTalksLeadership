## Files

* `crawler.py` is heavily inspired by [this project](https://github.com/ROC-HCI/TEDTalk_Analytics/).
 The code has been updated to accommodate changes done to the TED website since 2017. It has also been simplified for our project's purposes.
* Talk IDs that have already been crawled are stored in `to_skip.txt`. 
* `ted_talks_metadata_transcripts_FULL.csv`: the full dataset (a sampled version will be provided later)
