    "Using a large amount of transcripts from TED and TEDx talks, our project aims at exploring the relationship between the use of **charismatic leadership tactics** (CLTs) and **follower reaction**. CLTs refer to speech techniques such as metaphors, stories, three-part lists, etc. (Antonakis et al., 2012). Follower reaction is an indicator of popularity derived from metrics such as the number of views or YouTube \"(dis)likes\".\n",

    "The project builds on previous work done by Prof. John Antonakis (University of Lausanne) and his colleagues around **leadership** and **charisma** (see Antonakis, 2006; Antonakis et al., 2016 among others).\n",
    "\n",
    "Partnering with Prof. Antonakis, Philip N. Garner and his team from the Idiap Research Institute in Martigny (Switzerland) trained a **recurrent neural network** based on the transcripts of 240 TED talks, to estimate the usage probability of CLTs in textual data (for more details on the model, see Garner et al., 2018). The CLTs in each transcript had to be coded by hand using specific guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deep learning model allows the **prediction of the nine CLT values** (`collective`, `contrast`, `goal`, `goals2`, `list`, `metaphor`, `moral`, `question`, `story`) for any given text. If CLTs do indeed correlate positively with the aforementioned metrics, then testing this tool on a larger data pool would be a good way of checking its performance. It may very well be that the deep learning tool requires more training data to provide more consistent and accurate results. If anything, the data collected in the scope of our project provide **more observations** to train the model (although the initial coding of CLTs would still have to be done manually).\n",
    "\n",
    "Parting ways with the analysis based on CLTs, our data can also be used with another machine learning application, namely **IBM Watson Personality Insights**, which makes a psycholinguistic analysis of text to predict scores in each of the Big Five personality traits ([OCEAN model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)), as well as some additional metrics such as consumer needs and values. It is meant to be more of a business application, but since personality traits like extroversion and openness to experience are thought to be qualities of a good leader (see works cited by Antonakis, 2006), it constitutes an interesting approach to compare with the previous one."

It would be interesting to gather then analyze the audio and/or video of those same TED(x) talks. As in the project led by Garner, this would require an initial coding phase to classify talks based on certain aspects of the speaker's speech (pitch, volume, speed, tone of voice, pauses...) or appeareance (e.g. **face symmetry**). Other criteria than CLTs or personality traits would first have to be identified in order to bring that work to fruition."

Besides, querying the API requires a known parameter like the name of the speaker or the YouTube ID, information that was not in our possession at the start of this project.\n",
    "* **Downloading an existing dataset**: user _rounakbanik_ from Kaggle published a dataset of about 2,500 TED talks containing both metadata and transcripts. We decided not to use it because of the relatively small number of talks and the fact that it only goes until September 2017. However, we should note the presence of a feature which does not exists anymore, `ratings`. At some point, the website users were able to rate the talks using terms such as \"inspiring\", \"fascinating\", \"jaw dropping\", etc. These votes could be integrated at a later stage by joining the Kaggle dataset to our own, and learning the ratings for records where this feature is missing.\n",
    "* **Parsing the TED RSS feed**: suggested on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7239836/ted-talk-api-or-workaround-for-data-access), parsing the XML file of the TED talks [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TedtalksHD?fmt=xml) was also considered, but quickly rejected because of its short time range (one year only) and the lack of relevant metadata. \n",

When we _do_ get timed out, the script waits for a random number of seconds between 1 and 60.\n",

For example, some data would not be written correctly to the CSV file (i.e., fields being split across several lines, or some records not being written at all unless a `flush()` is performed) or some errors were not handled correctly. But more importantly, we realized only later that we would need the YouTube ID in order to supplement our dataset with the YouTube data. We noticed at the same time that the native language was also available in the JSON object. This information proved to be very valuable, because it allowed us to exclude all non-English talks (in which we were not interested).\n",

    "As far as **data types** are concerned, most of the numerical data was identified as floats. We converted these features to integers because it made more sense given their nature. We also created proper date-time objects from the timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we looked at **transcript quality**. We know that the TED transcripts were written by humans and therefore can be trusted. For the ones coming from YouTube, however, it's another story. From the summary statistics above, we deduce that some transcripts are probably of dubious quality and should be discarded, such as the 732 English talks that were autogenerated from a language other than English, as well as the 239 transcripts of _non-English_ talks that were autogenerated from English.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of characters in a transcript (without spaces) is made available in the `nb_char` feature. We also removed transcripts containing **less than 100 characters** for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They may contain irrelevant data like \"WEBVTT\".\n",
    "* They may represent art performances (dance, music).\n",
    "* The IBM tool requires at least 100 words to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the remaining cleaning operations were about **unifying similar fields** from both the TED and YouTube datasets. When data from the TED dataset was missing (e.g. duration = 0, no comments, no transcript, etc.), we retrieved its equivalent from the YouTube dataset (if it was available). Numeric values from both sources, such as views and comments, were **added** to get an overall picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then got rid of **redundant columns**, either because they did not interest us in the scope of this project, or contained duplicate information. The remaining columns were renamed and reordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since transcripts are the most relevant feature for this project, we **split the data** into two separate dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* English talks _with_ transcript (`df`)\n",
    "* English talks _without_ transcript (`df_notranscript`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for talks having a transcript, we unpacked the relevant values from the IBM personality profile, i.e. the **Big Five percentiles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: the cleaning function contains several parameters to remove specific categories of records according to the user's needs (mostly to avoid encountering null values during regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `remove_autogenerated`: remove records with an autogenerated YouTube transcript (which could potentially improve the models, even though this discards a large portion of transcripts).\n",
    "* `remove_empty_popularity`: remove records that do not have a popularity score (about 100 talks; see section below).\n",
    "* `remove_empty_big5`: remove records that do not have a personality profile."

    "Ultimately, the goal of the project is to check whether the use of CLTs in a talk is **correlated with follower reaction**. The problem is that the data presents us with several metrics that could be used for that purpose : views, likes and dislikes, comments, the number of languages the talk was translated to... Therefore, we wanted to **combine** some of them in order to get a single metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula we settled on is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\ln({\\sqrt{\\frac{likes+1}{dislikes+1}}\\times views})}{1+\\frac{\\ln{days}}{\\sqrt{\\ln{days}}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this formula is to use the **like-to-dislike ratio** (to both of which 1 is added in order to prevent null results) as a way to tell how much a view is worth. A perfect balance of likes and dislikes translates to a ratio of 1, which does not change the value of each view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this ratio can potentially get disproportionately big, it is squared. The **natural logarithm** is then applied to the whole dividend in order to get a reasonable order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since views and (dis)likes are a function of time, we control for the **time elapsed** (in days) between the publication of the video on YouTube and April 30 2020, which is when the querying of the YouTube API ended (ideally, a timestamp should have been recorded at the time of query in order to get a more accurate value). Because the daily number of views on a video naturally decreases over time after a a while (usually), we designed the formula's divisor in such a way that it does not increase linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the values are normalized using **min-max scaling** in order to get a more interpretable scale."
